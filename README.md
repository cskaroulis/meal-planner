# meal-planner

The meal planner is an app that will assist families in managing two very tedious weekly tasks: selecting meals and creating a shopping list.

## Documentation

A user will be able to:

- register to create an account
- log into the created account
- create, search for, update and remove ingredients
- create, search for, update and remove recipes
